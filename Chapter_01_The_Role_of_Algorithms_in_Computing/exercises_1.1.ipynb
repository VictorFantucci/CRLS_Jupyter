    "- O(1) lookup of elements using the array index.\n",
    "- Allocation is straightforward - can be allocated on the “call stack” or as permanent, static structures at compile-time if there be need. The latter is often used in embedded systems and other constrained environments. More complex structures may require dynamic allocation (or at least something that uses a static structure to “pretend” to do dynamic allocation).\n",
    "- Elements in C-style arrays are in contiguous memory areas (at least contiguous virtual memory if not always “real” memory).\n",
    "- Dynamic arrays and stack-allocated or static/global arrays can mostly be treated similarly.\n",
    "- Arrays can be initialized for easy use as lookup tables and similar structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages versus more “dynamic” structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fixed size; if the array becomes “full” and you need more elements, you either have to create a new array and copy your existing array into it (expensive) or you have to come up with a more clever data structure, possibly a list of arrays or something similar.\n",
    "- If the array isn’t fully used, you waste space.\n",
    "- Reordering or swapping array elements is expensive versus structures like Linked lists.\n",
    "- Stack-allocated arrays in C have some annoying behaviors when passed to functions, such as sizeof(array) changing from the size of the whole array to the size of the array pointer (unless you’re using a very modern version of C and declare the array parameter carefully)."
